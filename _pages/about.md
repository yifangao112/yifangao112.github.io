# 🧑‍🎓 About me
I'm a **Ph.D student in School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China**, advised by Prof. [Xin Gao](http://sibet.cas.cn/sourcedb/zw/yjdw/yjy/201306/t20130621_3879548.html). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering from Northeastern University in 2022. My research interests lie in **medical image analysis** and **AI in medicine**. My goal is to address medical challenges through computational methods and contribute to improving the quality of healthcare. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a keen interest in sports and game data analysis. I maintain [PAGE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10123061), a large-scale annotated database of professional Go games. I am also the developor of DeepKylin, an AI agent for Gomoku. It won the [National Computer Game Tournament](http://computergames.caai.cn/) in both 2020 and 2021. In 2020, DeepKylin won all 20 matches, and in 2021, it continued its dominance with an impressive record of 42 wins and 1 loss.
