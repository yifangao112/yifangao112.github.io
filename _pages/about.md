# üßë‚Äçüéì About me
I'm a Ph.D student at School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China. I'm also pursuing my doctoral studies at the Shanghai Innovation Institute (‰∏äÊµ∑ÂàõÊô∫Â≠¶Èô¢) through a joint program, advised by Prof. [Xiaosong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c66GnOEAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Xin Gao](http://sibet.cas.cn/sourcedb/zw/yjdw/yjy/201306/t20130621_3879548.html). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering from Northeastern University in 2022. My research interests include medical image analysis and AI in medicine, with a particular focus on developing **Foundation models** and **Multimodal LLMs** for healthcare applications. My goal is to address medical challenges through computational methods and contribute to improving the quality of healthcare. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a keen interest in sports and game data analysis. I maintain [PAGE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10123061), a large-scale annotated database of professional Go games. I am also the developor of DeepKylin, an AlphaZero-like AI agent for Gomoku. It won the [National Computer Game Tournament](http://computergames.caai.cn/) in both 2020 and 2021.

[Multimodal Large Language Models Address Clinical Queries in Laryngeal Cancer Surgery: A Comparative Evaluation of Image Interpretation Across Different Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00499)

Bingyu Liang#, **Yifan Gao#**, Taibao Wang, Lei Zhang, Qin Wang

**International Journal of Surgery**

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=lzAiM94AAAAJ&citation_for_view=lzAiM94AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='lzAiM94AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC'></span></strong>
- Six multimodal large language models (MLLMs) were evaluated across 6 image types, 169 images, and 1084 open-ended clinical questions in laryngeal cancer surgery. Advanced MLLMs demonstrate high accuracy (up to 79.43%) in interpreting diverse image modalities, with commercial models outperforming open-source alternatives. MLLMs show potential to enhance clinical decision-making across the surgical timeline of laryngeal cancer, from preoperative planning to post-operative care.

[DeSAM: Decoupled Segment Anything Model for Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00499)

**Yifan Gao**, Wei Xia, Dingdu Hu, Wenkui Wang, Xin Gao

**MICCAI 2024**

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=lzAiM94AAAAJ&citation_for_view=lzAiM94AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='lzAiM94AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC'></span></strong>
- DeSAM addresses the performance degradation of SAM in automatic segmentation scenarios. By decoupling the mask generation process from prompts and introducing prompt-relevant IoU and prompt-decoupled mask modules, DeSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in two public datasets.

[MBA-Net: SAM-driven Bidirectional Aggregation Network for Ovarian Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00499)

**Yifan Gao**, Wei Xia, Wenkui Wang, Xin Gao

**MICCAI 2024**

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=lzAiM94AAAAJ&citation_for_view=lzAiM94AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='lzAiM94AAAAJ:f6ydRqryjwC'></span></strong>
- We developed MBA-Net, a novel architecture for ovarian tumor segmentation that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with domain-specific knowledge through bidirectional feature aggregation. MBA-Net demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy, robustness to tumor heterogeneity, and strong generalization capability across different imaging modalities and clinical sites.
